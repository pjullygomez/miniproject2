<!-- Data Backups -->
<!-- What are data backup services
Data backup services provide companies the protection they
 need to keep all of their data secure. With these services
  in place, businesses can confidently access, review, and 
  safeguard their data – and their customers’ data – from both
   accidental and malicious data loss events.

Third-party data backup and recovery services are
 delivered by independent software vendors (ISVs)
  or managed service providers (MSPs), who offer
   tools and support that make data protection
    efforts easy, efficient, and secure while
     shifting the responsibility for backup creation,
      management, storage, and recovery processes to
       experienced professionals. Put simply, data backup
        services help businesses focus their attention and 
        resources elsewhere while staying confident that the 
        data that keeps them in the black is always secure and available. -->


<!-- Data Security -->
<!-- Data security is the practice of protecting digital information
 from unauthorized access, corruption, or theft throughout its
  entire lifecycle. It’s a concept that encompasses every aspect
   of information security from the physical security of hardware
    and storage devices to administrative and access controls, as
     well as the logical security of software applications. It also 
     includes organizational policies and procedures.

When properly implemented, robust data security strategies will
protect an organization’s information assets against cybercriminal 
activities, but they also guard against insider threats and human error, 
which remains among the leading causes of data breaches today. Data security
 involves deploying tools and technologies that enhance the organization’s 
 visibility into where its critical data resides and how it is used. Ideally, 
 these tools should be able to apply protections like encryption, data masking, 
 and redaction of sensitive files, and should automate reporting to streamline 
 audits and adhering to regulatory requirements. -->

 <!-- Network Equipment -->
 <!-- Network equipment
Various types of network equipment can be used in 
cloud data centers. Servers contain network interface 
cards (NICs) which are used to provide the server CPU(s) 
with external Ethernet ports. These NICs are used to connect 
the servers to switches in the network through data cables. The 
term switch is generally used for equipment that forwards data 
using layer 2 header information. Sometimes, an Ethernet switch 
may also be referred to as an Ethernet bridge and the two terms 
can be used interchangeably. The term router is generally used for 
equipment that forwards data using layer 3 header information. Both 
switches and routers may be used within large cloud data center networks, 
and, in some cases, Ethernet switches can also support layer 3 routing. -->
